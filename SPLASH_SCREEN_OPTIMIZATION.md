# Splash Screen Optimization

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Loading Screens
- **Deleted `ThemeLoadingScreen.tsx`**: No longer needed as splash screen handles initialization
- **Deleted `SimpleLoadingScreen.tsx`**: Replaced with native splash screen behavior
- **Removed loading screen imports**: Cleaned up unused imports in `_layout.tsx`

### 2. Updated App Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)
- **Removed loading screen components**: No more custom loading screens
- **Added splash screen state management**: `isAppReady` state to control when to hide splash
- **Added timeout fallback**: 5-second timeout to prevent infinite splash screen
- **Simplified initialization flow**: App waits for theme initialization before hiding splash

### 3. Splash Screen Behavior
- **Native splash screen**: Uses Expo's built-in splash screen from `app.config.js`
- **Theme-aware**: Supports both light (`#ffffff`) and dark (`#000000`) backgrounds
- **Automatic hiding**: Hides when app initialization and theme loading complete
- **Timeout protection**: Forces hide after 5 seconds to prevent hanging

## How It Works

1. **App starts**: Native splash screen shows immediately (configured in `app.config.js`)
2. **Initialization**: App initializes storage, database, theme, and location services
3. **Theme loading**: Waits for theme to be fully initialized
4. **Splash hide**: Hides splash screen and shows the main app
5. **Fallback**: If anything takes too long, splash screen hides after 5 seconds

## Benefits

- **Faster perceived startup**: Native splash screen shows instantly
- **Better UX**: No custom loading screens or timeouts
- **Cleaner code**: Removed complex loading screen logic
- **Theme support**: Splash screen adapts to light/dark themes
- **Reliable**: Timeout ensures app always loads

## Configuration

The splash screen is configured in `app.config.js`:

```javascript
splash: {
  image: "./assets/splash-icon.png",
  backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
  resizeMode: "contain",
  dark: {
    backgroundColor: "#000000"
  }
}
```

This provides a seamless experience where users see your branded splash screen immediately when the app launches, and it smoothly transitions to the main app once everything is ready.
