# Performance Optimizations Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the SkyePie weather app.

## üöÄ Key Performance Improvements

### 1. React Component Optimizations

#### Memoization
- **WeatherScreen**: Wrapped with `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **WeatherCard**: Optimized with `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
- **WeatherIcon**: Memoized image selection and accessibility labels
- **ThemeProvider**: Memoized context value to prevent cascade re-renders

#### Performance Monitoring
- Added performance monitoring to all major components
- Track render times and identify bottlenecks
- Real-time performance metrics in development mode

### 2. Hook Optimizations

#### useOfflineWeather Hook
- **Memoized weather service creation** to prevent recreation on every render
- **Performance monitoring** for all async operations
- **Optimized favorite locations loading** with batching (3 concurrent requests max)
- **Better error handling** with fallback to cached data

#### useTheme Hook
- **Memoized theme calculations** to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- **Optimized storage operations** with better error handling

### 3. Service Layer Optimizations

#### WeatherService
- **Enhanced caching** with TTL (Time To Live) management
- **Performance monitoring** for all API calls
- **Request deduplication** to prevent duplicate API calls
- **Optimized retry logic** with exponential backoff

#### Database Operations
- **Performance monitoring** for database initialization
- **Optimized queries** with proper indexing
- **Connection pooling** for better resource management

### 4. Image Loading Optimizations

#### WeatherIcon Component
- **Memoized image selection** to prevent recalculation
- **Optimized emoji fallback** with memoization
- **Better error handling** for failed image loads
- **Preloaded weather icons** for faster rendering

### 5. Theme System Optimizations

#### ThemeContext
- **Memoized theme selection** to prevent recreation
- **Optimized context value** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Better theme switching** performance

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Built-in Performance Monitor
- Real-time performance metrics
- Component render time tracking
- API call performance monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Component render times
- API response times
- Database operation times
- Image loading times
- Theme switching performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Performance Utilities

### Debouncing and Throttling
```typescript
// Debounce expensive operations
const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchFunction, 300);

// Throttle frequent updates
const throttledUpdate = throttle(updateFunction, 100);
```

### Memoization
```typescript
// Memoize expensive calculations
const expensiveCalculation = memoize(calculationFunction);

// Memoize with custom key generator
const memoizedWithKey = memoize(calculationFunction, (a, b) => `${a}-${b}`);
```

### Batch Processing
```typescript
// Batch operations for better performance
const batchProcessor = new BatchProcessor(processItems, 10, 100);
batchProcessor.add(item);
```

## üéØ Performance Best Practices

### 1. Component Optimization
- Use `React.memo()` for components that receive stable props
- Use `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
- Use `useCallback()` for event handlers passed to child components
- Avoid creating objects/functions in render methods

### 2. State Management
- Minimize state updates
- Use functional updates when possible
- Batch related state updates
- Use refs for values that don't need to trigger re-renders

### 3. API Optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use request deduplication
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor and log performance metrics

### 4. Image Optimization
- Preload critical images
- Use appropriate image formats
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical images
- Provide fallbacks for failed loads

### 5. Database Optimization
- Use proper indexing
- Implement connection pooling
- Monitor query performance
- Use batch operations when possible

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Target Performance Goals
- **Initial Load Time**: < 2 seconds
- **Component Render Time**: < 16ms (60 FPS)
- **API Response Time**: < 1 second
- **Theme Switch Time**: < 100ms
- **Image Load Time**: < 500ms

### Monitoring Tools
- Built-in performance monitor
- React DevTools Profiler
- Flipper performance tools
- Custom performance metrics

## üîß Development Tools

### Performance Monitor Component
```typescript
import { PerformanceMonitor } from './components/common/PerformanceMonitor';

// Use in development
<PerformanceMonitor visible={__DEV__} />
```

### Performance Utilities
```typescript
import { 
  debounce, 
  throttle, 
  memoize, 
  performanceMonitor 
} from './utils/performanceOptimizations';
```

## üö® Performance Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Creating objects in render methods**
2. **Not memoizing expensive calculations**
3. **Over-fetching data from APIs**
4. **Not implementing proper caching**
5. **Creating too many small components**
6. **Not using proper list virtualization**
7. **Ignoring memory leaks**
8. **Not monitoring performance metrics**

## üìù Performance Checklist

## üîÑ Continuous Monitoring

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Regularly:
1. Monitor performance metrics
2. Profile the app with React DevTools
3. Check for memory leaks
4. Optimize slow components
5. Update performance targets
6. Test on different devices and network conditions
